# TO-DO LIST

this is a React todo list (no redux) based on a tutorial from [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/create-a-simple-to-do-app-with-react). I am using the basic concept and optimizing it for my needs and learning experience.

## Is it still a work in progress?

Yes!  I'm thinking that this exercise can be simplified further.  Also, I didn't really style it much.

## Is this hosted somewhere?

Presently no.  More to come on that.

## How do I start this thing?

On the command line type `npm start`.
