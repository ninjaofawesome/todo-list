# TO-DO LIST

this is a basic todo list (no redux) based on a tutorial from [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/create-a-simple-to-do-app-with-react). I am using the basic concept and optimizing it for my needs and learning experience.

More documentation to follow as this is currently a work in progress.
